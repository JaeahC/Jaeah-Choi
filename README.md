# Jaeah Choi

I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics and Disruptive Innovation from Hult International Business School. Previously, I graduated Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic Engineering from Incheon National University in Korea, concentrating in Wireless power transmission, RF, and wireless communications.
I have 1+ year of experience as a test engineer. I was part of the production and operation team to test RMAs(Return Merchandise Authorization), and collect the data to help the R&D to improve the products. After, I have taught high school students for 4+ years to help them get into a good college. Also, I work as an operation analyst 1+ year.
Throughout my professional and academic journey, I find myself passionate about empowering coding and analyzing the data to suggest better business decisions.
